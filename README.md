# Netflix Recommendation System

### Capstone Project - IIT Madras (PgD in DSAI)

As a part of my PG Diploma in Data Science & AI, I worked on building a recommendation system for Netflix, a popular online streaming platform. The aim of the project was to recommend movies and TV shows to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

I utilized various Machine Learning techniques such as Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to analyze the user's past ratings and preferences, and generate recommendations accordingly. I also implemented a hybrid approach that combined both methods to generate more personalized and accurate recommendations.

I trained the models using the Netflix dataset, which contained over 100 million ratings from over 500,000 users. I evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as RMSE, precision, recall, and F1 score.

This project helped me to gain hands-on experience in building recommendation systems and understand the practical applications of Machine Learning in real-world scenarios. I also gained knowledge of various algorithms and techniques used in recommendation systems, and the trade-offs involved in choosing different methods.
